TEST CASE GENERATORS

Another side project to improve efficiency during my internship.
 
These scripts were made to automate the process of reading business documents and creating test cases -
something which was being done manually at the time of creation and was a very time-intensive task. 
Now, 1000s of testcases can be generated in seconds. The code is also very easy to modify for 
various different types of tests and parts of the application. 


It uses XLRD to read an excel document (business documents)
and XLWT to write to another document simultaneously.
